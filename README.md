This project was created to simulate a webapp: Princess Cruises using Cloud technologies from Microsoft Azure. This project utilized the best features of Cloud technologies to improve the website's availability, reliability, performance and scalability. The website utilized active directory which mitigates security risks, multiple region hosting to ensure high availability and fast webpage loading,traffic manager to help balance server load during extreme flunctuation, continous delivery to ensure zero downtime during updates, auto-scaling to ensure the server does not overload and prevent under-utilization, automated testing from source control to ensure the codes are fault-proof before deployment and geo-replication for backup.
